The sliding behavior you’re observing could be due to several factors including the physical properties of the robot, the control method used, or the simulation settings. Here are a few suggestions to address this issue:

Friction Properties:
 Check the friction properties of the robot’s wheels and the surface it’s moving on. If the friction is too low, the robot might slide instead of moving in the desired direction. You can adjust the friction properties in the physics material properties of the robot’s wheels and the surface.

Control Method:
 If you’re using a velocity control method to move the robot, consider switching to a position or force control method. Velocity control can sometimes result in sliding behavior, especially if the desired velocity changes abruptly.

Physics Simulation:
 Check the physics simulation settings in Isaac Sim. Make sure the physics engine is accurately simulating the interaction between the robot and the environment. You might need to adjust the physics timestep or the solver iterations for a more accurate simulation.

Wheel Configuration:
 Ensure that the wheel configuration of your robot is correctly set up. For a 4-wheel robot, typically, the wheels should be set up in a differential drive configuration. Check the alignment and orientation of the wheels.

Robot’s Weight:
 Check the weight of your robot. If the robot is too light, it might slide around. You can adjust the mass properties of the robot in the physics properties.
Remember that making these adjustments might require a balance between accuracy and performance.
